## StealthApp

This app performs a malicious behavior to leak the IMEI of a device to the out
of the world via SMS.
It utilizes functions of 2 benign apps to achieve obtaining IMEI number and sending
SMS respectively instead of implementing these functions itself.
In this way, it hides its malicious behaviors.
  * The source code of this app can be found at: <https://github.com/gaojun0816/tiktok_stealer>
  * The required 2 benign apps are: com.globalcanofworms.android.simpleweatheralert and org.communicorpbulgaria. bgradio respectively. Out of anonymous review consideration, shortcut links to download these 2 apps will be revealed later. But they also can be downloaded from [AndroZoo](https://androzoo.uni.lu/) with SHA256: 7E8365752A1AEE0F15E65E3D5A7A56B691E208880545987DEEA493B35965F3D5 and 3754F46387F856CE4398790B7F3CA62F5E62EE41DD8DBDD47C3B9EC4B393F578 respectively.
