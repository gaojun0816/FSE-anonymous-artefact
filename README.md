## StealthApp

This app performs a malicious behavior to leak the IMEI of a device to the out
of the world via SMS.
It utilizes functions of 2 benign apps to achieve obtaining IMEI number and sending
SMS respectively instead of implementing these functions itself.
In this way, it hides its malicious behaviors.
  * The source code of this app can be found at: <https://github.com/gaojun0816/tiktok_stealer>
  * The download link to the 2 benign apps will be provided after anonymous review. (Since the link cannot be anonymized)
